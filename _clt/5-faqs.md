### Is this the same as a "land bank"? {#land-bank}

No, a land bank is typically public entity run by a city or county that gives the government more power to manage land and hold land for future development. 

Community land trusts are a form of nonprofit organization that stewards land and provides opportunity for home ownership to low-income people. 

Land banks and community land trusts can work together but they aren't the same.

### Where will the money come from? {#money}

The community land trust would need income from multiple sources to be sustainable. 

A couple sources of revenue are built into the CLT model: 
1. **Lease payments** - The CLT leases land to home owners, and some maintenance costs can be incorporated into this fee.
2. **Membership** - CLTs are typically membership organizations, so they can charge dues to members.

In addition, a core part of a CLT is selling buildings to residents. An old building can be donated to the CLT, then the CLT members can invest sweat equity into fixing up the building. By selling the improved building to a resident, the CLT generates revenue that can be used for future projects.

The CLT also doesn't have to sell all of its buildings to low-income residents. If a donated building can be fixed up and sold to a middle-income resident, that revenue can subsidize projects for lower-income residents.

All this means that the CLT can generate revenue from:
* Unskilled volunteer labor
* Skilled volunteer labor
* Donated or discounted building supplies

The CLT can partner with local unions and technical schools since the buildings can be excellent learning opportunities for students and apprentices. 

Finally, money can come from federal, state, and local grants, as well as loans. Some specialized loan funds offer "patient money" with low rates to programs like community land trusts.

The value of donated items, land, and labor of can often also be considered match funds when applying for grants.
