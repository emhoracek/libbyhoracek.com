### Is this the same as a "land bank"? {#land-bank}

No, a land bank is typically a public entity run by a city or county that gives the government more power to manage and hold land for future development. 

Community land trusts are a form of nonprofit organization that stewards land and provides opportunity for home ownership to low-income people. 

Land banks and community land trusts can work together but they aren't the same.

### Where will the money come from? {#money}

The community land trust would need income from multiple sources to be sustainable. 

A few sources of income or revenue are built into the CLT model: 
1. **Lease payments** - The CLT leases land to home owners, and some maintenance costs can be incorporated into this fee.
2. **Membership** - CLTs are typically membership organizations, so they can charge dues to members.
3. **Building sales** - While the CLT retains ownership of the land, it does *sell* the building to new residents.

If an old building is donated to the CLT, the CLT members can invest sweat equity into fixing up the building. By selling the improved building to a new resident, the CLT generates revenue that can be used toward future projects.

Usually, the new residents are low-income, and the cost they can pay for a building is going to be significantly lower than market-rate. But the CLT also doesn't have to sell all of its buildings to low-income residents. Revenue from selling nicer buildings to middle-income residents could help subsidize projects for lower-income residents.

All this means that the CLT can generate revenue from:
* Unskilled volunteer labor
* Skilled volunteer labor
* Donated or discounted building supplies

For some of this labor, the CLT can partner with local unions and technical schools. Community land trust buildings can be excellent learning opportunities for students and apprentices. 

Finally, money can come from:
* donations
* federal, state, and local grants
* loans

Some specialized loan funds offer "patient money" with low rates to programs like community land trusts.

The value of donated supplies, land, and labor of can often also be considered match funds when applying for grants.
