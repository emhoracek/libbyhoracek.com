Wheeling is facing many problems with housing, including:
* Homelessness
* Increasing rents
* Abandoned buildings

A community land trust or CLT can help with these problems. The CLT will create affordable housing from dilapidated buildings and promote home ownership with built-in safeguards to keep the housing affordable long-term.
