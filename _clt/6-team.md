### Libby Horacek

Libby Horacek grew up in Moundsville and has lived in the Valley most of her life. In 2015, she left Wheeling to start a career in technology. She was hired at [Position Development](https://positiondev.com), a small software development consultancy. For the next five years, she helped the business convert from a traditional LLC partnership to a worker-owned cooperative, and in the process, joined New York City's vibrant [solidarity economy](http://solidaritynyc.org/#/about). 

Libby moved back to Wheeling in 2020 while continuing to work remotely for Position Dev. She was a member of the board of trustees for Elm Grove Civics in 2024 and is currently a member of [Ohio Valley Mutual Aid](https://ovmutualaid.org). Libby has felt for years that a community land trust is a missing piece in Wheeling's housing systems and is determined to make it happen.
