A community land trust or CLT is a non-profit that obtains land and acts as a steward of that land long-term in the interests of a community. The CLT members create policies about how their land can be used. Typically, CLTs use the land for affordable housing.

How it could work in Wheeling:
1. The CLT buys or is donated a dilapidated building.
2. The CLT works with an interested resident and relevant experts to make a plan for the building.
3. The resident buys the *building* from the CLT while the CLT retains ownership of the *land*.
4. The CLT and new owner work together to make the building liveable.
4. The owner makes monthly lease payments to the CLT and continues to build equity.
5. The owner eventually sells their home to a new resident with the oversight of the CLT.

The membership and board will have three parts to represent different members of the community:
* CLT Residents 
* Community members
* Relevant experts and elected officials
